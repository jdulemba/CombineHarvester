Map_2HDMC_in.py:
-Usage: It maps the result from 2HDMC calculator to the corresponding parameter values in the input file of SusHi, e.g. 2HDMC_physicalbasis.in

SusHi_automate.sh:
#Used with an input.txt file as input parameters for mass and tanb (See examples in ./SusHi/results/ggA_sgn/scan_NNLO/input/input.txt)
-Example
#IMPORTANT: Please specify the type of Higgs boson by editing the line > h="12" # 11 = h, 12 = H, 21 = A
#You may also change the order of calculation by editing the shell script
> ./SusHi_automate.sh input.txt
-Usage: Automatically calculate the cross-sections (which also returns the widths) for all the input mass and tanb values

SusHi_read.py:
-Example
> python SusHi_read.py ./path-to-output-files/ --higgs A -o SusHi_mA_out.txt
> python SusHi_read.py ./path-to-output-files/ --higgs H -o SusHi_mH_out.txt
-Usage: It reads the output xs and widths from the SusHi output and save all output values into a txt file

MakeSusHi.py:
-Example
> python MakeSusHi.py SusHi_mA_out.txt --higgs A
> python MakeSusHi.py SusHi_mH_out.txt --higgs H
-Usage: It creates a root file containing histograms for xs and width and coupling with x and y axis being mass and tanb
